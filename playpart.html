    <h3 class="elvsted">MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p class="direction">[After a pause, suddenly sits up in her chair, and listens eagerly. Then she sinks back again wearily, moaning to herself.]</p>
    <p class="speech"> Not yet!--Oh God--oh God--not yet! </p>
    <p>BERTA slips cautiously in by the hall door.  She has a letter in her hand.</p>

    <h3 class="elvsted">MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p class="direction">[Turns and whispers eagerly.]</p> 
    <p class="speech">Well--has any one come? </p>

    <h3 class="breta">BERTA.</h3>
    <p class="direction">[Softly.]</p> 
    <p class="speech">Yes, a girl has just brought this letter.</p>

    <h3 class="elvsted">MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p class="direction">[Quickly, holding out her hand.]</p>
    <p class="speech"> A letter! Give it to me!</p>

    <h3 class="breta">BERTA.</h3>
    <p class="speech">No, it's for Dr. Tesman, ma'am.</p>


    <h3 class="elvsted">MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p class="speech">Oh, indeed.</p>

    <h3 class="breta">BERTA.</h3>
    <p class="speech">It was Miss Tesman's servant that brought it. I'll lay it here on the table.</p>

    <h3 class="elvsted">MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p class="speech">Yes, do.</p>

    <h3 class="breta">BERTA.</h3>
    <p class="direction">[Laying down the letter.] </p>
    <p class="speech">I think I had better put out the lamp. It's smoking.</p>

    <h3 class="elvsted">MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p class="speech">Yes, put it out. It must soon be daylight now.</p>

    <h3 class="breta">BERTA.</h3>
    <p class="direction">[Putting out the lamp.] </p>
    <p class="speech">It is daylight already, ma'am.</p>

    <h3 class="elvsted">MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p class="speech">Yes, broad day! And no one come back yet--!</p>

    <h3 class="breta">BERTA.</h3>
    <p class="speech">Lord bless you, ma'am--I guessed how it would be.</p>

    <h3 class="elvsted">MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p class="speech">You guessed?</p>

    <h3 class="breta">BERTA.</h3>
    <p class="speech">Yes, when I saw that a certain person had come back to town--and that he went off with them. For we've heard enough about that gentleman before now.</p>
