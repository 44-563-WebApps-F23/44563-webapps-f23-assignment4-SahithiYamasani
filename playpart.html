    MRS. ELVSTED.
    [After a pause, suddenly sits up in her chair, and listens eagerly. Then
    she sinks back again wearily, moaning to herself.] Not yet!--Oh God--oh
    God--not yet!
    BERTA slips cautiously in by the hall door.  She has a letter in
    her hand.

    MRS. ELVSTED.
    [Turns and whispers eagerly.] Well--has any one come?

    BERTA.
    [Softly.] Yes, a girl has just brought this letter.

    MRS. ELVSTED.
    [Quickly, holding out her hand.] A letter! Give it to me!

    BERTA.
    No, it's for Dr. Tesman, ma'am.


    MRS. ELVSTED.
    Oh, indeed.

    BERTA.
    It was Miss Tesman's servant that brought it. I'll lay it here on the table.

    MRS. ELVSTED.
    Yes, do.

    BERTA.
    [Laying down the letter.] I think I had better put out the lamp. It's smoking.

    MRS. ELVSTED.
    Yes, put it out. It must soon be daylight now.

    BERTA.
    [Putting out the lamp.] It is daylight already, ma'am.

    MRS. ELVSTED.
    Yes, broad day! And no one come back yet--!

    BERTA.
    Lord bless you, ma'am--I guessed how it would be.

    MRS. ELVSTED.
    You guessed?

    BERTA.
    Yes, when I saw that a certain person had come back to town--and that he
    went off with them. For we've heard enough about that gentleman before
    now.
