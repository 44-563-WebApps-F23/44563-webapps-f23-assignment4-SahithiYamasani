    <h3>MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p>[After a pause, suddenly sits up in her chair, and listens eagerly. Then she sinks back again wearily, moaning to herself.] </p>
    <p> Not yet!--Oh God--oh God--not yet! </p>
    <p>BERTA slips cautiously in by the hall door.  She has a letter in her hand.</p>

    <h3>MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p>[Turns and whispers eagerly.]</p> 
    <p>Well--has any one come? </p>

    <h3>BERTA.</h3>
    <p>[Softly.]</p> 
    <p>Yes, a girl has just brought this letter.</p>

    <h3>MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p>[Quickly, holding out her hand.]</p>
    <p> A letter! Give it to me!</p>

    <h3>BERTA.</h3>
    <p>No, it's for Dr. Tesman, ma'am.</p>


    <h3>MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p>Oh, indeed.</p>

    <h3>BERTA.</h3>
    <p>It was Miss Tesman's servant that brought it. I'll lay it here on the table.</p>

    <h3>MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p>Yes, do.</p>

    <h3>BERTA.</h3>
    <p>[Laying down the letter.] </p>
    <p>I think I had better put out the lamp. It's smoking.</p>

    <h3>MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p>Yes, put it out. It must soon be daylight now.</p>

    <h3>BERTA.</h3>
    <p>[Putting out the lamp.] It is daylight already, ma'am.</p>

    <h3>MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p>Yes, broad day! And no one come back yet--!</p>

    <h3>BERTA.</h3>
    <p>Lord bless you, ma'am--I guessed how it would be.</p>

    <h3>MRS. ELVSTED.</h3>
    <p>You guessed?</p>

    <h3>BERTA.</h3>
    <p>Yes, when I saw that a certain person had come back to town--and that he went off with them. For we've heard enough about that gentleman before now.</p>
